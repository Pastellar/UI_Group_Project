### Update Regarding Milestone 01 Tasks
> Found in Project Management Document
Originally, we planned to split up the site tasks as shown in the Project Management Document.
Haven found she was able to handle most of the tasks as she worked on the 'Functional Prototype'.

'Note:' Haven ran into an issue while setting up a new AWS server. She opted to host the prototype 
site on a preexisting server for this Milestone due to time constraints. The error should be resolved 
by Milestone 03, and site files will be migrated over.
