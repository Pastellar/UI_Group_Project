# Functional Prototype
### Links

'Note:' This site is temporarily hosted on a preexisting AWS server I created for a separate class due to an 
error I ran into when setting up an AWS server for this project. The error should be resolved by Milestone 03,
I didn't have enough time to fix it before the due date so I opted to temporarily use my other server.
